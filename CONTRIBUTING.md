## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitHub first, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bionewsbot.git
   cd bionewsbot
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/romwil/bionewsbot.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Linux/Mac:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   # venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy example environment file

   # Make sure to set up test database credentials
   ```

5. **Start Development Services**
   ```bash
   # Start all services in development mode
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

   # Or start specific services:
   docker-compose up -d postgres redis
   ```

6. **Initialize Database**
   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   cd backend
   alembic upgrade head

   # Seed development data (optional)
   python scripts/seed_dev_data.py
   ```

7. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run tests to ensure everything is working
   ./run-tests.sh

   # Start development servers
   # Backend (in one terminal):
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

   # Frontend (in another terminal):
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

### Development Tools

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting for Python
- **ESLint**: Code linting for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Prettier**: Code formatting for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **MyPy**: Static type checking for Python
- **Pytest**: Testing framework for Python
- **Jest**: Testing framework for JavaScript

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues. When creating a bug report, include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Exact steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Your environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
- Explanation of why this enhancement would be useful
- Possible implementation approach (if you have one)

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:
- `good first issue` - Simple issues good for beginners
- `help wanted` - Issues where we need community help
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

### Pull Requests

1. Create your feature branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes following our style guidelines
3. Add or update tests as needed
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Submit a pull request to the `develop` branch

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use Black for code formatting (configuration in `pyproject.toml`)
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules

```python
# Good example
def calculate_sentiment_score(text: str, model: SentimentModel) -> float:
    """Calculate sentiment score for given text.

    Args:
        text: The text to analyze
        model: Pre-trained sentiment model

    Returns:
        Sentiment score between -1.0 (negative) and 1.0 (positive)
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Code Style

- Use ESLint configuration provided
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Prefer functional components in React
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use meaningful component and variable names

```typescript
// Good example
interface CompanyCardProps {
  company: Company;
  onSelect: (id: string) => void;
}

export const CompanyCard: React.FC<CompanyCardProps> = ({ company, onSelect }) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### API Design Guidelines

- Follow RESTful principles
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Version APIs appropriately
- Include proper error responses
- Document all endpoints

### Database Guidelines

- Name tables in plural (e.g., `companies`, `articles`)
- Use snake_case for column names
- Always include created_at and updated_at timestamps
- Add appropriate indexes for query performance
- Document complex queries

## Commit Messages

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks
- **ci**: CI/CD changes

### Examples

```
feat(api): add endpoint for company sentiment analysis

Implemented new /api/v1/companies/{id}/sentiment endpoint that
returns historical sentiment data for a specific company.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(notifications): correct Slack message formatting

Fixed issue where markdown formatting was not properly rendered
in Slack notifications for company alerts.
```

## Testing Requirements

### Python Tests

- Write tests using pytest
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Include unit and integration tests
- Mock external services appropriately

```python
# Example test
def test_sentiment_analysis():
    """Test sentiment analysis returns expected score."""
    analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()
    score = analyzer.analyze("This drug shows promising results")
    assert 0.5 <= score <= 1.0
```

### JavaScript Tests

- Write tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Test component behavior, not implementation
- Include snapshot tests for UI components
- Test error states and edge cases

```typescript
// Example test
describe('CompanyCard', () => {
  it('should call onSelect when clicked', () => {
    const handleSelect = jest.fn();
    const { getByText } = render(
      <CompanyCard company={mockCompany} onSelect={handleSelect} />
    );

    fireEvent.click(getByText(mockCompany.name));
    expect(handleSelect).toHaveBeenCalledWith(mockCompany.id);
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Tests

- Use Playwright for E2E tests
- Cover critical user journeys
- Run against staging environment
- Include in CI pipeline
